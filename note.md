- I replaced direct MySQL queries with Frappe API calls for inserting and querying data.
- The frappe.db.exists function is used to check if a user with a given email already exists.
- The frappe.get_doc method is used to create a new document (user) in the "tabHealth_Care_Users" Doctype.
- The frappe.get_all method is used to query user data based on the email.


- This modification uses the Bootstrap grid system to center the form within a container. The container, row, and col-md-6 classes are used to achieve this layout. Adjust the values based on your design preferences.

# Blueprints start

- In the provided Flask code, `doctors.edit_doctor` refers to a route endpoint defined within the `doctors_bp` Blueprint. Let me break it down:

1. `doctors` is the name of the Blueprint, which is created using:

    ```python
    doctors_bp = Blueprint('doctors', __name__)
    ```

   This Blueprint is registered in your main `app.py` file using `app.register_blueprint(doctors_bp)`. The Blueprint is essentially a way to organize related routes and views.

2. `edit_doctor` is a route endpoint defined within the `doctors_bp` Blueprint:

    ```python
    @doctors_bp.route('/edit_doctor/<string:doctor_id>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def edit_doctor(doctor_id):
        # ... (route logic)
    ```

   This route is designed to handle both `GET` and `POST` requests for the URL path `/edit_doctor/<string:doctor_id>`. It expects a dynamic parameter `doctor_id` in the URL, which is captured and passed to the `edit_doctor` function.

So, when you see `doctors.edit_doctor` in the `url_for` function, it's specifying the endpoint for the `edit_doctor` route within the `doctors_bp` Blueprint. The syntax is `BlueprintName.endpoint`.

For example, if you want to generate a URL for the `edit_doctor` route, you can use:

```html
<a href="{{ url_for('doctors.edit_doctor', doctor_id=some_doctor_id) }}">Edit Doctor</a>
```

Here, `some_doctor_id` is a placeholder for the actual ID of the doctor you want to edit. When the link is clicked, it will navigate to the `edit_doctor` route within the `doctors_bp` Blueprint, and the `doctor_id` parameter will be populated with the appropriate value.
