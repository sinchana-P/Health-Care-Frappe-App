# pip install fastapi mysql-connector-python


- If you want to use plain SQL and connect to a MySQL database using the configuration you provided, you can use the mysql.connector library to manage the database operations. First, make sure you have fastapi and mysql-connector-python installed:


--------------------------- api/register/

- In FastAPI, the "dependency system" is a feature that allows you to define reusable components or functions that can be injected into your route functions. These dependencies can perform tasks such as authentication, data validation, and, in this case, managing database connections. The purpose of using FastAPI's dependency system is to ensure clean and efficient management of resources, like database connections, across your application.

Let's break down the two statements:

"This code follows the recommended practice of using FastAPI's dependency system to manage database connections."

This statement means that the code provided is using FastAPI's recommended approach to handle database connections. In the code, the get_database_connection function is defined as a dependency using the Depends function. When a route function, like register_user, includes db: mysql.connector.MySQLConnection = Depends(get_database_connection), FastAPI will automatically call get_database_connection to get a database connection and pass it as an argument to the register_user function. After the route function is executed, FastAPI will ensure that the database connection is properly closed.

"The code provided does not use FastAPI's dependency injection system to manage database connections and cursor operations."

This statement refers to the original code you provided before the improvements. In that code, database connections were created and managed directly within each route function without using FastAPI's dependency system. This approach can lead to issues with resource management because it doesn't ensure consistent handling of connections, and it can make the code less maintainable.

By using FastAPI's dependency injection system, as shown in the improved code, you benefit from:

Automatic handling of resource initialization and cleanup (e.g., database connections are opened and closed properly).
Reusability of code for managing common tasks, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.
Improved consistency and clarity in your code, as the handling of dependencies is centralized and explicit.



---- api/login/

We've included db: mysql.connector.MySQLConnection = Depends(get_database_connection) as a parameter in the login_user function to make use of FastAPI's dependency injection system. This ensures that a database connection is automatically provided and properly closed after the function is executed.

Inside the login_user function, we perform the database operation to check if the provided username and password match a record in the database.
